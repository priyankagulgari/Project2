# Project2
Developed a predictive model to estimate car prices using machine learning techniques.
- Identified a suitable dataset from Kaggle.Explored and cleaned the dataset; addressed missing values and converted categorical data into numerical format.
- Implemented three different regression models- Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor and Decision Tree Regressor to predict the car prices.
- Calculated mean squared error, mean absolute error and R-squared scores to assess model accuracy.
- Developed a predictive model to estimate car price based on various features.
